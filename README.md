# AnyRestDotNet
This is a prototype of my AnyRest project, written in C#. It is still work in progress.

Final version is supposed to be written in RUST once funtionality is locked down.

Is is a self contained API server, that can wrap one or more command line(s) (windows/linux/mac) in REST endpoints.
I believe this to be very usefull for hobby projects and fast prototyping of API's.

Endpoints and actions for http methods are defined in an JSON configuration file.
